# Core Coding Standards

- Write clean, readable code with consistent naming and structure.
- Prefer small, focused functions and clear module boundaries.
- Use modern Python syntax (3.11+), f-strings, dataclasses where appropriate.
- Include type hints for public functions and complex data structures.
- Add docstrings for public modules, classes, and functions.
- Keep dependencies minimal and standard-library first.

## Testing Requirements

- Write unit tests for new behavior and bug fixes.
- Favor deterministic tests; avoid network and time dependencies.
- Use pytest and arrange/act/assert structure.
- Name tests descriptively and cover edge cases.

## Formatting & Style

- Follow PEP 8 and format with Black-compatible style.
- Sort imports with isort-compatible grouping.
- Keep lines reasonably short (<= 100 chars).

## AI Coding Workflow

- When editing, read the file first and preserve existing style.
- Prefer small, incremental edits with minimal changes.
- Avoid security tooling or checks unless explicitly requested.
